# Image Captioning

* Deployed Application on Heroku
- https://image-caption-tool.herokuapp.com/
* To Run the Pipeline
- python main.py [specific model_config]

The model will be trained, tested, and used to produce good and bad captions. The model outputs will be in the experiment_data folder. The captions will be generated in the captions folder.

## Usage

* Define the configuration for your experiment. See `default.json` to see the structure and available options. You are free to modify and restructure the configuration as per your needs.
* Implement factories to return project specific models, datasets based on config. Add more flags as per requirement in the config.
* Implement `experiment.py` based on the project requirements.
* After defining the configuration (say `my_exp.json`) - simply run `python3 main.py my_exp` to start the experiment
* The logs, stats, plots and saved models would be stored in `./experiment_data/my_exp` dir. This can be configured in `contants.py`
* To resume an ongoing experiment, simply run the same command again. It will load the latest stats and models and resume training pr evaluate performance.
